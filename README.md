# al dente obsidian theme

a simple minimal theme for [the obsidian notes app](https://obsidian.md/) that is tender, but firm. it is built to be _just right_ for me. hopefully it is just right for others as well.

## notes

i wanted a nice simple interface that was functional and easy on the eyes. 

i started with [the BENFW theme](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/theme-benwf-light-dark-deprecated/1998) back in early summer and have been tinkering with it off and on since. mostly cleaning up colors, alignment, and spacing. i've added several bits and pieces since then. still definitely a work in progress. i mostly use the light theme, but am playing around with dark theme because many people like dark themes. i like warm colors and minimal visual clutter. i get distracted when things don't line up. 

## fonts

you can easily change fonts in the variables at the top of the document. 

i'm using [Poppins](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/poppins) as the main font, [Prompt](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prompt) for headings, and [Courier Prime Code](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/courier-prime-code) for code blocks.
